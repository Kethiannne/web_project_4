**Techniques**

Utilizing Javascript made this project especially challenging, as it was my first practical use of the language. I ended up thoroughly enjoying playing around with it, and look forward to more!

Grid and Flexbox are here as always, with grid handling my image cards, and flexbox handling... well pretty much everything else!

Forms! We learned them a few weeks ago but didnt get to do anything with them until now...
I wish there had been a basic form on a previous project, but I suppose without Javascript to give them purpose there... wouldnt be much of a purpose?

I have added Media Queries to allow things to resize according to brief guidelines, nothing too fancy here, but after our last project I was honestly relieved by that. I really enjoy the ability to change background images via media queries!
